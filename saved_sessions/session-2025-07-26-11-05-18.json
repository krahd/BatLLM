Our bot has a limited set of commands and zero tolerance towards messages that don't match one of its commands. If your response (that is, the bot's input message) does not match a valid command, then our bot does nothing and we lose a turn. The commands that the bot understand are either a single upper case M, S or B, an S followed by wither 0 or 1 (S0, S1), or a C or an A followed by a number between 0 and 360. \nCn and An with n between 0 and 360 make the bot rotate clockwise (C) or anticlockwise (A) n degrees. An M makes the bot move forward a fixed length. The bot has a shield. S1 makes it raise its shield, S0 makes it lower it, and an S alone makes it toggle its shield state. B makes the bot shoot a bullet forward.. The bot cannot shoot with its shield raised, a B command is ignored by the bot if its shield is raised.

Our bot has a limited set of commands and zero tolerance towards messages that don't match one of its commands. If your response (that is, the bot's input message) does not match a valid command, then our bot does nothing and we lose a turn. The commands that the bot understand are either a single upper case M, S or B, an S followed by wither 0 or 1 (S0, S1), or a C or an A followed by a number between 0 and 360. \nCn and An with n between 0 and 360 make the bot rotate clockwise (C) or anticlockwise (A) n degrees. An M makes the bot move forward a fixed length. The bot has a shield. S1 makes it raise its shield, S0 makes it lower it, and an S alone makes it toggle its shield state. B makes the bot shoot a bullet forward.. The bot cannot shoot with its shield raised, a B command is ignored by the bot if its shield is raised. When a bullet hits a bot it makes its health go down, unless its shield is raised and the bullet hits the protected area. The shield stops bullets but prevents the bots from shooting. We are now in a round of 10 turns. This prompt will be given to you in every single turn and you need to respond with a command. Choose randomly one of the admissible letters: M, S, B, C or A. If your chosen letter is C or A, add to it a random number between 0 and 360. Always give one of these commands.

The commands that the bot understand are either a single upper case M, S or B, an S followed by wither 0 or 1 (S0, S1), or a C or an A followed by a number between 0 and 360. \nCn and An with n between 0 and 360 make the bot rotate clockwise (C) or anticlockwise (A) n degrees. An M makes the bot move forward a fixed length. The bot has a shield. S1 makes it raise its shield, S0 makes it lower it, and an S alone makes it toggle its shield state. B makes the bot shoot a bullet forward.. The bot cannot shoot with its shield raised, a B command is ignored by the bot if its shield is raised. When a bullet hits a bot it makes its health go down, unless its shield is raised and the bullet hits the protected area. The shield stops bullets but prevents the bots from shooting.

Before each round I will enter the prompt that you will receive once per each turn. Your job is to answer with a string that will be passed verbatim to our bot. Our bot has a limited set of commands and zero tolerance towards messages that don't match one of its commands. If your response (that is, the bot's input message) does not match a valid command, then our bot does nothing and we lose a turn. The commands that the bot understand are either a single upper case M, S or B, an S followed by wither 0 or 1 (S0, S1), or a C or an A followed by a number between 0 and 360. \nCn and An with n between 0 and 360 make the bot rotate clockwise (C) or anticlockwise (A) n degrees. An M makes the bot move forward a fixed length. The bot has a shield. S1 makes it raise its shield, S0 makes it lower it, and an S alone makes it toggle its shield state. B makes the bot shoot a bullet forward.. The bot cannot shoot with its shield raised, a B command is ignored by the bot if its shield is raised. When a bullet hits a bot it makes its health go down, unless its shield is raised and the bullet hits the protected area. The shield stops bullets but prevents the bots from shooting. We are now in a round of 10 turns. This prompt will be given to you in every single turn and you need to respond with a command. Always give one of these three commands: S0, C20, or B. Nothing else, do not add anything, you response must be one of these three strings chosen randomple and nothing else. Either S0, C20, or B.\n",

Our bot has a limited set of commands and zero tolerance towards messages that don't match one of its commands. If your response (that is, the bot's input message) does not match a valid command, then our bot does nothing and we lose a turn. The commands that the bot understand are either a single upper case M, S or B, an S followed by wither 0 or 1 (S0, S1), or a C or an A followed by a number between 0 and 360. \nCn and An with n between 0 and 360 make the bot rotate clockwise (C) or anticlockwise (A) n degrees. An M makes the bot move forward a fixed length. The bot has a shield. S1 makes it raise its shield, S0 makes it lower it, and an S alone makes it toggle its shield state. B makes the bot shoot a bullet forward.. The bot cannot shoot with its shield raised, a B command is ignored by the bot if its shield is raised. When a bullet hits a bot it makes its health go down, unless its shield is raised and the bullet hits the protected area. The shield stops bullets but prevents the bots from shooting. We are now in a round of 10 turns. This prompt will be given to you in every single turn and you need to respond with a command. Always give one of these three commands: S0, C20, or B. Nothing else, do not add anything, you response must be one of these three strings chosen randomple and nothing else. Either S0, C20, or B.\n",
