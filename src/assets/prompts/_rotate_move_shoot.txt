Using your coordinates and rotation and your opponent's coordinates and rotation calculate if it would make sense to shoot.
There are only two places where the oponent can be, p1: its current position or p2, at a distance of STEP_LENGTH in the directon of its rotation.
Check whether a line from your position in the ditection of your rotation would intersect with a circle of radius bot.radius centered in p1 or in p2, and store the result in a boolean variable named "X1". Do the same but checking whether they would hit us, and store it in a boolean named X2.

Now follow this decision table:

X1 & H1 & !S1-> B
X1 & H1 & !S1 & X1 -> S
X1 & H1 & !S1 & X1 -> S1
H1 & !S1 & X2 -> M
H1 & !S1 & !X2 -> R
H1 & S1

where X1 is bot 1 hits bot 2
X2 is bot2 hits bot1
S1 is bot 1's' chield and S2 is bot2's shield




H and not S -> B
H and S -> M
not H 


If 
If 
    rotate to point to it.
else if you are more than .3 away from your opponent, 
        move.
      else if your shield is up, 
                lower it
            else 
                shoot.
