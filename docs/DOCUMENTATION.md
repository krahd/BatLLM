## BatLLM's Documentation

This page will act as the *main page* of the documentation, focusing on discussing the project as a whole, shocasing its goals, motivations, results, and teachings. 

As the project reaches new milestones, new versions of this page will be created.

The documentation is split in the following sections:
- **[Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)**, this file.
- **[Readme](README.md)**, introduces the project, the repository and the game.
- **[User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md)** shows how to *play* BatLLM
- **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** explains how to *develop* BatLLM
- **[FAQ](FAQ.md)**, or frequently Asked Questions
- **[Credits](CREDITS.md)**, project collaborators

NOTE: to facilitate collaborative documentation the documentation might be moved into a Wiki soon.

*More coming soon...*
